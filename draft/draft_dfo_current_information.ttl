*       Check segment break fieldcard to ensure you are surveying the correct area (some additional areas may be required near peak on noted systems)
*       Conduct surveys in a downstream direction.  This is not the preferred method when conducting visual surveys; however, it is necessary to due to time constraints and logistics.
*       Avoid walking on redds and near fish on redds.
*       Investigate all hiding areas within a Segment carefully and thoroughly (e.g. logjams, cutbanks, over-hanging shrubs/grass, pools, etc.) to ensure the detection of Coho.
               - Coho are notorious for their ability to hide – if you think there is no way a Coho will be there CHECK IT ANYWAY!!
               - Check upstream of all beaver dams to confirm Coho presence/absence – do not assume a beaver dam is impassable.
               - Take your time when counting – do several counts of pools before recording the number of fish observed on your tally counter(s).  Move to the best viewing spot (lighting, height, etc.) 
                  when counting not just what is convenient and/or easiest for you.  Gently probe hiding areas with your peugh/wading staff or “rock” areas you cannot reach.
*       Conduct a minimum of 7 surveys per system (at a minimum, 5 high reliability counts are required for the AUC calcuation).
*       Survey systems on a 7-day rotation (survey interval).
*       Record the number of holders, spawners and carcasses observed on a Stream Inspection Log (SIL) field-card.
*       Record all unusual fish behaviour and environmental conditions observed on the SIL.
*       Surveyor efforts need to be consistent from one survey to the next and from one system to another.
